# My tweaked version of the delightful Daobeam theme

This extension is a slightly tweaked version of Daobeam to better match my current, JS and CSS heavy workflow.

If you happened to find this extension over the **official Daobeam theme**, please [head over there first](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-flanigan.Daobeam) to understand the theme's overall design choices! Spoiler: it's the best light theme on the market hands-down.

**Enjoy!**

## So what did I change?

See the Changelog for a full list of changes. But my general motivation for this: I wanted to better take advantage of the amazing italicized font I'm currently using ([hello MonoLisa](https://monolisa.dev)) ðŸ‘‹. As it stands, the official Daobeam doesn't use italics much at all, and I wanted to change that!

In the end, 99% of the theme's preferences remain untouched.
